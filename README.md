# Air_Quality_Prediction_In_Urban_Areas_Using_DL
Air is what keeps humans alive. Monitoring it and understanding its quality is of immense importance to our well-being.We will predict the quality of air on the basis of given predictions.We will use the air quality dataset.This dataset has fundamental  features that are used for determining the quality of wine.

Dataset Used - "EXL_EQ_2023_Dataset.csv"

# Steps to implement the prediction model :

*   Data Collection and Extraction
*   Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
*   Data Exploration & Data Analysis
*   Data Visualization
*   Data Preprocessing & Data Cleaning
*   Model Evaluation
*   Building a predictive system
